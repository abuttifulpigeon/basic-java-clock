## Introduction
This project is an open source implementation of a simple digital clock written in Java using Swing graphics framework. It features a user interface that displays the current local date and time using either 12 hour or 24 hour format based on whether the "Switch" button is pressed or not. The project includes a main method which runs the application when executed.

---

The `Main` class contains all the main functionality of the program. The constructor creates a `JFrame`, sets its size and background color, adds three panels as children (`timePanel`, `switchBtn`, and `titlePanel`), then initializes four labels: `militaryTime`, `switchBtn`, `title`, and `frame`. The `clock()` method updates the label text based on whether the system clock is set to 12-hour or 24-hour display mode. Finally, it starts a `Timer` object with an interval of one second to update the clock every second.
